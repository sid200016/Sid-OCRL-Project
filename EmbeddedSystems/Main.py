from CommunicateWGrasper import *
import subprocess

Goals for next two weeks:
- translating Catherine's graphical elements
- Skeleton of the logic: main.py -> main qt file that goes from frame 1 to frame 2. Click through and bypass. Logic would be a work in progress. Code/pseudocode in place, but no bridging between screens. Prioritize the action screen.

Things to control:
- gantry position <- priority 1
- Rigid Grasper <- priority 2
- Soft Grasper <- priority 3


Goal position:
Two options:
A) Monitor x-y position when object is released
B) Proctor can say whether object was sucessfully released
